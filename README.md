## About Me

Co-Founder of [Knowledge-Exploration Systems](http://kexp.io/) and a full stack software developer with experience in machine learning, data science, cloud engineering, web development, and database applications. My main languages are Python and JavaScript. I studied traditional computer science at WCSU and extended my knowledge to include machine learning by taking online courses, reading the classic books, reading research papers, and working on projects and competitions. Due to the intensive intellectual demands of mastering such a diverse field, I also co-founded [Danbury AI](https://www.meetup.com/DanburyAI/) in 2016 to foster a local community of AI experts and enthusiasts that help each other grow and learn. I have also given many tech talks to my community in order to help stimulate tech in my area.

I blog about software, mathematics, machine learning, philosophy, psychology, art and the connections between them. My main interest is machine learning and how it can be used to automatically build models that are near impossible for humans to develop with traditional methods.
